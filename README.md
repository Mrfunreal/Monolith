# Notes
- Modified "Loopy loop" queue points to fit new progress bar.
- Progress bar lowered specifically so Oneko can show up without being covered. It's not actually part of my theme, but a cat needs a bed.
- "Add to library" wait circle _might_ attach to elements added by extensions, and scale is a little off for "like playlists".
- Some progress bar additions, like the Kirby gif, seem to move up and down.

# Installation
It's recommended to find and install this theme on the [Spicetify Marketplace](https://github.com/spicetify/marketplace).<br> 
Which will also allow you to set scheme color in the app, without requiring a Spicetify reboot.


**Linux and MacOS** in Bash:
```bash
cd "$(dirname "$(spicetify -c)")/Themes"
git clone https://github.com/Mrfunreal/Monolith
```

**Windows** in Powershell:
```powershell
cd "$(spicetify -c | Split-Path)\Themes"
git clone https://github.com/Mrfunreal/Monolith
```

**Changing schemes manually**
This only applies if you're not using the marketplace to install the theme.
```Powershell
spicetify config current_theme Monolith
spicetify config color_scheme XXXXXX
spicetify apply
```
Replace XXXXXX with whichever color combination you would like. Eg. `spicetify config color_scheme Red-Orange`
